    abstract = {Collaborative Vehicular Perception (CVP) enables connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to cooperatively extend their views through wirelessly sharing their sensor data. Existing CVP systems employ either a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) view exchange paradigm. In this paper, we advocate a hybrid CVP design: our developed system, Harbor, employs V2I as its fundamental underlying framework, and opportunistically employs V2V to boost the performance. In Harbor, vehicles (helpers) may serve as relays to assist other vehicles (helpees) in reaching an edge node, which performs sensor data merging to produce the extended view. We judiciously partition the workload between the edge and vehicles, develop a robust helper-helpee assignment model, and solve it efficiently at runtime. We conduct both real-world tests and large-scale emulation experiments using two prevailing CAV applications: drivable space detection and object detection. Our real-world evaluation conducted at one of the world's first purpose-built autonomous driving testbeds demonstrates that Harbor outperforms state-of-the-art V2V- or V2I-only CVP schemes by up to 36\% in detection accuracy, resulting in significantly fewer collisions under dangerous driving scenarios.},

    abstract = {Like today's autonomous vehicle prototypes, vehicles in the future will have rich sensors to map and identify objects in the environment. For example, many autonomous vehicle prototypes today come with line-of-sight depth perception sensors like 3D cameras. These cameras are used for improving vehicular safety in autonomous driving, but have fundamentally limited visibility due to occlusions, sensing range, and extreme weather and lighting conditions. To improve visibility and performance, not just for autonomous vehicles but for other Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS), we explore a capability called Augmented Vehicular Reality (AVR). AVR broadens the vehicle's visual horizon by enabling it to share visual information with other nearby vehicles, but requires careful techniques to align coordinate frames of reference, and to detect dynamic objects. Preliminary evaluations hint at the feasibility of AVR and also highlight research challenges in achieving AVR's potential to improve autonomous vehicles and ADAS.},

However, GPS by itself cannot provide such precision in obstructed urban environments. In this paper, we present a system called CARLOC for lane-level positioning of automobiles. CARLOC uses three key ideas in concert to improve positioning accuracy: it uses digital maps to match the vehicle to known road segments; it uses vehicular sensors to obtain odometry and bearing information; and it uses crowd-sourced location of estimates of roadway landmarks that can be detected by sensors available in modern vehicles. CARLOC unifies these ideas in a probabilistic position estimation framework, widely used in robotics, called the sequential Monte Carlo method. Through extensive experiments on a real vehicle, we show that CARLOC achieves sub-meter positioning accuracy in an obstructed urban setting, an order-of-magnitude improvement over a high-end GPS device.},
