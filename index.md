Welcome to [Collaborative Intelligence Systems Lab](https://cisl.ucr.edu/) (CISL) at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/)!

Our lab invents collaborative intelligence in the networked cyber-physical systems. 
We build and deploy end-to-end cooperative autonomy that can achieve novel collective capabilities not previously demonstrated. 
Our enthusiasm lies in tackling real-world problems across various domains ranging from autonomous vehicles, drones, home robots, AR/VR/XR devices, to generic edge ML systems, intelligent infrastructure.
Our interdisciplinary innovation addresses the system challenges in networking, vision, robotics, machine learning, and edge computing.

*We are always looking for motivated talents to [join us](joinus).*
